# Mini-Projects

This directory contains small Xcode projects and playgrounds that demonstrate iOS concepts in practice.

## Purpose

Mini-projects serve to:
- Provide hands-on practice with confusing concepts
- Create working examples you can reference later
- Experiment with different approaches
- Build muscle memory through coding

## Structure

Each mini-project should:
1. Have its own directory
2. Include a README.md explaining:
   - What concept it demonstrates
   - How to run the project
   - Key learnings from building it
   - Link back to the concept documentation
3. Contain either an Xcode project or Swift playground

## Example Structure

```
mini-projects/
├── optional-chaining-demo/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── OptionalChainingDemo.xcodeproj/
├── async-await-practice/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── AsyncAwaitPractice.playground/
└── custom-view-animations/
    ├── README.md
    └── CustomAnimations.xcodeproj/
```

## Tips

- Keep projects small and focused on one concept
- Add comments explaining why you made certain choices
- Include screenshots or GIFs if the project has UI
- Don't worry about perfect code - these are learning projects!

## Project Ideas

When you encounter a confusing concept, consider creating a mini-project:
- Property wrappers demo
- Combine operators playground
- Custom transitions and animations
- CoreData relationships example
- URLSession and networking patterns
- Custom UIKit components
- SwiftUI state management examples

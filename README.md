# My iOS Journey 🍎

A personal documentation repository for tracking confusing iOS development concepts and learning through practical mini-projects.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as a living document of my iOS development journey. As I encounter concepts that are confusing or worth deeper understanding, I document them here. The combination of written explanations and practical mini-projects helps solidify my understanding.

## 📚 How to Use This Repository

### Adding a New Concept

1. Navigate to the appropriate category in `concepts/`
2. Create a new markdown file with a descriptive name (e.g., `optional-binding.md`)
3. Use the template from `templates/concept-template.md`
4. Document what confused you and how you understand it now

### Adding a Mini-Project

1. Create a new directory in `mini-projects/`
2. Include a README explaining what concept it demonstrates
3. Add the complete Xcode project or playground

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Document confusing concepts immediately when encountered
- Build practical examples to reinforce understanding
- Track progress and growth over time
- Create a personal reference guide

## 🌳 Using Git for Learning

This repository leverages Git's powerful features:
- **Branches**: Experiment with different approaches
- **History**: Track evolution of understanding
- **Commits**: Document learning milestones
- **Diffs**: See how understanding has improved

## 📝 Notes

This is a personal learning repository. The explanations are written in my own words and reflect my current understanding. As I learn more, I'll update and refine the documentation.
